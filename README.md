# todo-typscript
Welcome to My TypeScript Learning Project!
This repository showcases my journey into learning TypeScript and modern web development by building a Todo List application. As I explore TypeScript's features, work with vanilla JavaScript, and create a practical application, I gain valuable insights into type safety, code organization, and software development best practices.


TypeScript Basics: Dive into TypeScript fundamentals, including static typing, interfaces, classes, and modules.
Application Architecture: Understand how to structure a web application for maintainability and scalability.
User Interaction: Implement interactive features like adding, completing, and removing tasks from the list.
Data Persistence: Learn how to leverage localStorage for saving and loading tasks across sessions.
Responsive Design: Enhance my skills in building user-friendly and responsive interfaces.
Version Control & Collaboration: Utilize Git and GitHub for version control and collaborative development.
Project Progress
As I progress with this learning project, I will continuously update the repository to reflect my growing knowledge and skills. My journey will be documented in the commit history, and I welcome feedback from the community to help me improve.
